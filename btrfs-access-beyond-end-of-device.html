    <p>TL;DR: There's a problem in my filesystem and it made my important
file corrupted.</p>
<hr>
<h5><em>What's the scariest thing that happened in your life?</em></h5>
<p>In this post I want to share one of the scariest thing that happened to me:
BTRFS filesystem suddenly attempt to access beyond end of device and somehow it
made my GnuPG keyring into junk. GnuPG keyring is the one file that contains
key for public-key cryptography. Attempting to access beyond the end of device
made BTRFS auto-remount the device into read-only. And it happened right when
I'm playing with my gpg keyring (which I used to encrypt some important
passwords).  By the time I realized the problem, the keyfile has become junk in
the said device. Right now, I already solved the problem with some methods
which luckily available to me. Since I don't want the same experience haunts
other people, here's the full story of what happened and what I did to fix it.
I hope you'll find it useful!</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in a rainy day, I was inspecting my gpg keyring. I just
wanted to see what kind of file it is in binary. I kind of like randomly
seeing binary files (I know it's weird) to waste time. It's a great joy
looking at those unreadable, otherworldly junk text until when I quit (with
:wq for save-then-quit), vim gave me warning that it cannot sync with the
filesystem. Wait what? I wasn't even changing the file so what could
happened? Luckily the file buffer on vim is not closed yet (nice error
handling vim devs!), and I could copy the entire content of my keyring to
clipboard. But, where should I put it now? I tried saving into some other
file in my home folder and it gave the same error. Apparently, I tried to
create some random with contents and it failed (horribly so!). So I recall
that these kind of weird errors usually born from some kernel component and
look what I've got in my system log:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Feb 01 03:08:01 Tyria kernel: BTRFS error (device dm-1): bdev
/dev/mapper/Arch-home errs: wr 1, rd 0, flush 0, corrupt 0, gen 0
Feb 01 03:08:01 Tyria kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device

Feb 01 03:08:01 Tyria kernel: BTRFS warning (device dm-1): Skipping commit

</pre></div>


<p>I <strong>DO</strong> know that BTRFS is still experimental, and I kind of embraced the
errors that may come to me. But... I didn't expect the kind of error where
the filesystem tried to access beyond bounds.  Ok, what happened is
happened, but for now I need to somehow save my keyring first. Looking at
the error message I kind of guess it just happened on my /dev/Arch/home
device, so I might try saving it on /dev/Arch/root and voila! It works! Good
now I can go on to diagnose and fixing my filesystem.</p>
<h2>Diagnosing &amp; Fixing</h2>
<p>Actually, the first time I read the error, I don't even understand why it
attempt to access something beyond the end of device. It doesn't even make
sense, and I thought it tried to allocate new blocks somewhere outside the
device (which still doesn't make sense, because if the filesystem is full it
should give an error instead of attempting to write). I don't know what
caused BTRFS to act like that and just plain search it on the web which
solutions varies and after reading the problems again, they're differ too.
Apparently, this error message is given by the kernel for various filesystem
problems.</p>
<p>Since there's no specific problem related to the error message, I just tried
the basic <code>btrfs scrub start &lt;path&gt;</code> to find some leads. Scrubbing works by
checking device's blocks and metadata checksum and then compare it with the
one in the filesystem table, you got some errors if it differs. So, if
there's something wrong I should be able to notice.  But then it was aborted
in, like, 5 seconds right after I run it and only scrubbed 54 <strong>MiB</strong> of
space. Of course my filesystem is waaay more than that. And scrubbing also
gives new but same errors as before. So I guess what happened is when it's
trying to scrub, there's some file that is out of bound and boom, there goes
the errors.</p>
<p>So now, how do I access them then? Luckily, I've got a nice logical volume
(LV) layout like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>start ---------------------------------------- end
      |    root    |    home    |    swap    |
                          ^
                     problematic
</pre></div>


<p>Thus, my plan is remove the <code>swap</code> LV, extend the <code>home</code> LV, somehow gather
all the files' bits into the start of the LV, then shrink the <code>home</code> back,
and recreate the swap. Okay, here we go! First of all, remove the <code>swap</code> LV
and extend the <code>home</code> LV:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># swapoff /dev/swap
# lvremove /dev/swap
# lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/home
</pre></div>


<p>And the layout become like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>start ---------------------------------------- end
      |    root    |           home          |
                                 ^
                            problematic
</pre></div>


<p>After that, I use <code>btrfs scrub start /dev/home</code> to see if everything is
fine. Since I'm not patient, I run <code>watch btrfs scrub status /dev/home</code> so I
can monitor it. 10 Gigs, 30 Gigs, 50 Gigs, ..., and some minutes later it's
done! Nice, so the files are really goes beyond the end <code>/dev/home</code> LV and
we can try to gather the files. How do we do that? Fortunately, BTRFS
provides an on-line defragment tool with <code>btrfs filesystem defragment
&lt;partition&gt;</code>. At this point, I'm not really sure how BTRFS defragment works.
Usually it works like this:</p>
<p><img alt="defragment illustration" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/FragmentationDefragmentation.gif" title="Defragment Illustration"></p>
<p>It's usually implementation dependent, but nothing to lose right? (unless
the defragment feature is still experimental and I'll lose all my date
T_T). So I ran <code>btrfs filesystem defragment /dev/home</code>, and then wait till
it's done. How to check if it DOES worked? I don't know. Let's just try
return the LVs like before and then run BTRFS scrub:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># lvresize -L &lt;previous /dev/home size&gt; /dev/home
# lvcreate -L &lt;previous /dev/swap size&gt; -n swap &lt;group name&gt;
# mkswap /dev/swap
# swapon /dev/swap
# btrfs scrub start /dev/home
# watch btrfs scrub status /dev/home
</pre></div>


<p>After a moment, it says all the filesystem is checked and no errors on
systemd-journald and I can write things again. Yay! It does worked afterall.</p>
<hr>
<p>It sure is scary when my keyring almost gone, but it's
fun trying to fix the problem (although I don't know if this is truly a fix
or not). With that said, I think I can fix this because I'm lucky that right
after my <code>/dev/home</code> LV is my swap LV so I can remove it. I wonder what
should I do if it's not a swap LV (like, if the <code>/dev/root</code> trying to access
<code>/dev/home</code>)?</p>
<p>There are two things that I learn from this incident:
- Don't straight restart your machine if something failed on your computer.
  Make sure you don't have any loss first before going for the
  restart-route. Besides your own data, save the error logs that you got for
  future diagnose purpose (in case the error is not saved). You can always use
  pen and paper if you can't save it digitally.
- Actually, try not to use the restart-route if possible, especially if you
  use the computer quite often. It's just running from the problem.
  Restart-route will solve transient problems, and most likely it will
  happened again. Of course I can say this because I got the basic idea of
  how it works, but then again, you should have a friend (you do right?)
  that understand what happened. You're not living alone.</p>
