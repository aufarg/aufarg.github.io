</div>		<p>This is the last part of the Capture The Fun series. Somehow, I just got the mood to write this
now. Yes, 6 weeks after the event. I was busy dealing with life (career, family, and such).
Well, actually most of my time was spent on learning pwn. I feel like I'm really far behind
people so I tried to learn pwn like crazy. But, here goes the story of me and my team in SECCON
CTF.</p>
<h2>After Cyber Sea Games</h2>
<p>Not much to tell here since I'm applying for a job. Since I'm not really confident in my skill,
writing a resume took me a TON of time. Like, I actually start writing the resume in the October
of 2017 and it was done in December of 2017. It's kinda scary if I claim to know a certain
thing, let's say, Python, and the interviewer goes "Oh really, well how about you explain
&lt;insert some weird language intricacies>".  Well, I won't go into more details but real life
is what I've done until the event's date.</p>
<p>Oh I almost, we participated in the SECCON 2017 Online CTF. But instead of "we", it's actually
an "I". I can only get about 1400 points alone. One of my teammates got the extra 500 points tho
so it's cool. But that left us at <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/512">86th place</a>. Well, not bad
considering I'm the worst in the team.</p>
<h2>SECCON 2017 Final International Competition (Day 1)</h2>
<p>The contest is in King of the Hill format and running for about 7 hours for 2 days. So it's a 14
hours contest, but you can still try to solve the task in the mean time. For the tasks, we are
given some services, and we should get the flag from those services. Each service might have
more than one flag though so we need to look deeper even after getting a flag. A flag will give
you 100 "Attack Points". Much like the good ol' jeopardy-style.</p>
<p>The fun part is, each of these services ask you to get the best solution possible, depending on
the task. There's a code golf task which requires you to write the shortest possible brainfuck
code to spew "Hello World". There's also an optimization task which requires you to make the
response time of a certain code as fast as possible. If your solution is currently the best, you
got a "Defense Points". On each tick (IIRC, it is every 5 minutes), the platform will check the
team with best solution and grant a moderate amount of 20 points. The tick will only be count in
the 14 hours of contest. Basically, a flag is equal to 5 ticks/25 minutes. It's quite weird
because then the first team to get best solution will snowball. But I guess that's what it
should be in real life scenario. To be honest, the rule kinda makes it more fun.</p>
<p>I only worked on the optimization tasks. We are given a Raspberry Pi with a code in it. The
code will receive a certain request and should respond with the appropriate response. The code
will be executed as a cgi. Every 5 minutes, the judge will then start to do some sequential
requests and check if we return the appropriate response. If our code give all the correct
response, our score is the execution time. Else, we got 9999 for our execution time. If we can
do it below 20s, we got the flag (there's only one for this one).</p>
<p>Optimizing the code is actually quite straight forward. The problem is, they only provide a
manual checking request 7 minutes after the last request. At first, I spent about 3 hours stuck
at 9999, because I don't know what kind of response we should give (I was trying to respond with
succesful HTTP response). They give us a local checker, but it doesn't actually check the
correctness. It just send a HTTP request like what the judge would do without actually checking
whether the response it gets is right. But, looking at the code, I learn that it gives the judge some
images of Bingo boards and the request is changing the color of a number on any board that has
the number. So, we weren't meant to modify that could make the output different and we should
only make it more efficient. It took me 5 hours to realize this (yes, I'm so stupid).  Since I
only got 2 hours to optimize the code, I only have the chance to get the flag. I still have to
catch up with the other team (mine is 2x slower). I need to optimize it even at the
hotel.</p>
<h2>SECCON 2017 Final International Competition (Day 2)</h2>
<p>The next day, I tried the optimization, and it's actually slower by 2x! The judge
increase the difficulty of the requests (increase the number of boards and number to cancel). My
solution is doing 4x the other team. It's still quite good tho because the other team is at 5s,
and mine is 21s. So I kept on optimizing slowly but surely till mine is at 3.8s, but the other
team is at 3.3s. But then, I realized something. There should be a plateau to optimizations. If
I'm late at optimizing, I should have a better ratio than the other team that already optimized
it earlier because I could eliminate a bigger bottleneck than them. But, at the start of day,
the ratio between the speed of my solution and their solution increase instead from 2x to 4x.
While I could the runtime from 21s to 3.8, it's actually consists of small but many speed ups.
Like 10 of 50% increase factor, instead of one 200% increase. I know that I missed a big
optimization. Do I need to make the image processing faster with C? But the code used opencv
module which is already implemented in C (I think), so it will not be that big.</p>
<p>After thinking a bit while being kinda desperate, I realized that since it's an image, I should
try having a faster I/O. Wait, I/O? Raspberry Pi storage is an SD Card. It will be pretty slow, at
least much slower than my laptop's harddrive. Now that I think about it, Raspberry Pi processing
power is also slower than my laptop. So I try to hijack the Raspberry Pi IP address so the judge
will send the request to my laptop instead. And... it's 1.6s. Yep, it's 2.5x times faster, the
big bottleneck that I'm searching. I think it's already the peak of possible optimization and
with that, my team get the defense point untill the end of the competition. Near the end of
competition tho, team 217 occassionally got the defense point, meaning they also got to the
peak. Mine still have better runtime in most cases tho, might be because I try so hard
optimizing the little things.</p>
<h2>Competition Result</h2>
<p><img alt="SECCON 2017 Final International Competition
Scoreboard" src="https://aufarg.github.io/images/seccon-2017-final-scoreboard.jpg">
In the end, my team ended up in <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/510">8th place</a> (there's some problem
in the CTF Time's scoreboard, my team is actually <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/16919">this one</a>). But I'm
actually quite sad because I tried to solve the jeopardy pwn task, but I can't do it. Meanwhile,
this optimization task isn't a security thing. I bet most of the other team not spending so much
time in the task. So yeah, next is learn more pwn.</p>
<p>What makes me more sad is, because how far we are from the other teams regarding the
understanding of things. I tried eavesdropping their discussion about a certain problem, but I
didn't understand ANY of it. Not only we didn't understand enough to solve the task, we didn't
understand enough to learn from the other teams to fix our incapabilities. That is really sucks.</p>
<h1>Afterevent</h1>
<p>There's an afterevent party which the organizer unofficially held. We thought afterevent party
will have so many alcoholic beverages (which we should avoid), so we go back to our hotel. The
next day, we EXPLORE JAPAN! ... which I won't be covering here.</p>
<p>So, that's it. I think that, it's quite a valuable experience competing with the top CTF teams
in the world. I learnt that, we (especially me) are still quite far from being one of the good
CTF teams. But that's exactly what motivates me to learn more about it. I hope we will get
another chance to compete with this environment again, but next time, we'll be stronger and
could actually learn together with the other top teams.</p>
<p>See ya in another series (if I got another chance).</p>
